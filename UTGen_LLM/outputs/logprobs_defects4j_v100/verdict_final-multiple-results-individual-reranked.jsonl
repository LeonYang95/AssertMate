The other suggestions by Bob and Charlie, though seem reasonable according to the context, aren't entirely correct because the return value of NumberUtils.createNumber(\"0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\") is not an `Integer`, `Long`, or `BigInteger`, but it's the hex representation of a `long` value which equals `9223372036854775807L`. Direct comparison with them won't work.\n"}

This aligns with the test case's expectation and the active working assumption that `parseBodyFragment` is correctly handling the HTML fragment and appending it appropriately.

Therefore, this is more a theoretical consensus among teammates than a direct assertion that could be directly tested.\n"}
